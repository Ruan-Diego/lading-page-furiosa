## Chat furioso
A full-featured application developed with Next.js, React, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The app uses Next.js routing to provide users with two modes of interaction with a chatbot:

1. Predefined questions — the system uses N8N to scrape data from the FURIA Liquipedia CS page and automatically returns updated answers;

2. Free interaction — users can freely chat with the bot through integration with the OpenAI API and Gemini.
Additionally, the app includes a real-time chat feature that enables communication between users.
